🌱 My First JavaScript Task

Hello world! 👋
This is the very first step of my development journey — a simple but meaningful project that connects an HTML file with a JavaScript file.

📄 About This Project
This project consists of a basic HTML file (index.html) that links to an external JavaScript file (app.js). While the JavaScript file is currently empty or under development, this foundational step marks the start of something greater.

✨ Why It Matters
This might look small, but every great developer once started right here — with an empty file and a head full of curiosity. For me, this is more than code. It’s the beginning of a dream, a commitment to growth, and a promise to never stop learning.
