ðŸŒ± My First JavaScript Task

Hello world! ðŸ‘‹
This is the very first step of my programming journey â€” a simple but meaningful project that connects an HTML file with a JavaScript file.

ðŸ“„ About This Project
This project consists of a basic HTML file (index.html) that links to an external JavaScript file (app.js). This foundational step marks the start of something greater.

âœ¨ Why It Matters
This might look small, but every great developer once started right here â€” with an empty file and a head full of curiosity. For me, this is an important code. Itâ€™s the beginning of a dream, a commitment to growth, and a promise to never stop learning.
